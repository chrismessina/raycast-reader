Flipcause listed its headquarters as an office by Oakland’s Jack London Square in a new bankruptcy filing that shows the extent of the startup’s debts to nonprofit groups.

The idea for Flipcause was simple. Starting in 2012, the Oakland [startup](https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/bay-area-tech-scene-dorky-now-terrifying-21042943.php) provided technical tools for thousands of nonprofit organizations, handling the work of online storefronts, donation systems and ticketing pages. Millions of donor dollars flowed through Flipcause’s tech to nonprofits focused on just about every societal issue.

Then, this year, much of that money suddenly stalled under Flipcause’s control, as evidenced by testimonials from client companies on [social media,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/1ozxhx5/comment/nvl13kx/) with the [Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/32425-better-business-bureau-alerts-nonprofit-organizations-to-complaints-against-flipcause-inc), and to SFGATE. Nonprofits across the country were left in the lurch, unable to access the donor cash that funds their work in education, food distribution, health care, [legal defense](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/trump-fires-san-francisco-immigration-judge-21043584.php) and more. 

In October, a class-action [lawsuit](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.458371/gov.uscourts.cand.458371.1.0.pdf) accused Flipcause of fraud, led by a nonprofit that said it was out $75,000. In November, California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a cease and desist against the company, accusing it of withholding $615,000 in donations. Finally, on Dec. 19, Flipcause filed for bankruptcy, proof of just how far the startup has fallen.

The bankruptcy [filing](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.200073/gov.uscourts.deb.200073.1.0.pdf) lists some astonishing figures. Flipcause has about $30.5 million in debts, more than $29 million of which is money owed to more than 3,200 nonprofits, foundations and other organizations. Flipcause owes $1.2 million to the Sweet Relief Musicians Fund, a nonprofit for struggling musicians based in Brea, California. Loveland Foundation, which provides therapy and programming for Black women, is owed $701,000. Flipcause also owes $100,000 or more to the Second Harvest Food Bank of San Joaquin & Stanislaus Counties, the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice, San Diego-based Border Angels and about two dozen other organizations.

“Donors placed their trust in Flipcause to ensure their contributions reached those in need,” Bonta said when he [issued](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-warns-fundraising-platform-flipcause-immediately-stop-its) the cease and desist order. “Instead, charities are experiencing significant financial stress due to the platform holding these funds back. This is simply unacceptable.”

Against its $30.5 million in liabilities, Flipcause listed about $20.2 million in assets on its bankruptcy filing. The company said it has more than a million dollars in a merchant account with the financial tech company Stripe. The other big listed asset is dubbed “other intangibles, web platform,” and pegged at $15 million in value. This tally, the filing notes, has not been appraised by a professional within the last year.

## What Flipcause is saying

As nonprofit leaders waited on Flipcause to send through payments from donors this year, many got unsatisfying answers. Better Business Bureau complaints and emails shared with SFGATE by two Flipcause clients show that Flipcause repeatedly blamed its automated clearing house provider, or the system behind its money transfers, for the holdup in transfers.

“We still are currently investigating the issue with our ACH processor to ensure a resolution,” the company told Lompoc-based 805UndocuFund over email in May. “We are sending another follow-up with our ACH service provider regarding your transfers. We will update you as soon as we receive further information.”

Flipcause closed its message with, “Rest assured we will have your transfers processed to you as soon as possible.” As of December, the company still owes 805UndocuFund, which [helps undocumented and mixed-status families in Central California](https://www.sfgate.com/centralcoast/article/ice-raids-overwhelm-california-communities-20319412.php) deal with immigration enforcement, more than $350,000, according to the nonprofit and the bankruptcy filing.

Alongside the bankruptcy filing on Dec. 19, Flipcause’s executive chairman, Emerson Ravyn, filed a [declaration](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.200073/gov.uscourts.deb.200073.4.0.pdf) that explained his point of view on the company’s struggles. It did not mention any ACH issues like the ones the company had blamed in its correspondence with 805UndocuFund.

Ravyn wrote that “the story of Flipcause is one of community, perseverance and purpose,” and said that “from meager beginnings, Flipcause has grown to become the backbone of online fundraising for thousands of nonprofits across all fifty states.”

He explained that in 2023 and 2024, the company had reached record highs of revenue and profitability, adding to management’s hope that some kind of transaction, like a sale, might be possible. He wrote that the team believed a new structure would help solve Flipcause’s “legacy capital constraints,” and support its future. But the deal would never come, Ravyn wrote, even though Flipcause hired an investment banker to help find a buyer, and sought auction bids by July 2025.

The leadership team kept looking for a deal into this fall, but options were slim. Flipcause began plotting its bankruptcy. On Dec. 4, Stripe placed a hold on Flipcause’s credit reserves, Ravyn wrote, meaning that the financial company has more than a million dollars of Flipcause’s funds. He added that the hold blocks Flipcause from providing service to its nonprofit clients, and argued the same point about its business in California, under Bonta’s cease and desist order, which it’s appealing. Part of Ravyn’s declaration was aimed at getting the company’s six full-time employees and five contractors paid during the bankruptcy proceedings.

Neither Flipcause, its bankruptcy lawyer nor Ravyn immediately responded to SFGATE’s requests for comment, nor to questions about the bankruptcy filing and funds still owed to clients. [Oakland Voices](https://oaklandvoices.us/2025/11/12/where-is-flipcause-donation-platform-oakland/), which has closely chronicled nonprofit groups’ issues with Flipcause, reported in November that the company’s listed Jack London Square address in Oakland doesn’t seem to have been used by the company in at least two years.

[KGO-TV](https://abc7news.com/post/exclusive-wheres-money-oakland-california-based-company-flipcause-accused-mishandling-nonprofits-donations-us/17809391/), when it covered complaints about the company in September, quoted an anonymous Flipcause salesperson who said, “The way it is being handled is horrendous. Not even we as employees are getting any real answers or timelines on what the (expletive) is going on.”

## ‘Enraging and deeply harmful’

It’s unclear exactly how the bankruptcy proceedings will unfold, and what kind of recourse the nonprofit organizations owed millions in donor funds can expect. But the uncertainty is nothing new.

Primitiva Hernández, the executive director of 805UndocuFund, told SFGATE over email that her organization has only received one payment from Flipcause, almost six months after the organization requested its money in January. The missing money, $352,500, should be going toward emergency assistance and rapid response for her organization’s work. She called the situation “both enraging and deeply harmful,” and wrote that vulnerable communities are paying the price of the delays.

“When a fundraising platform fails to responsibly manage and release charitable funds, it creates a serious breach of trust and causes real harm,” Hernández added. “The consequences fall directly on nonprofits and, more importantly, on the families who depend on those resources to survive crises.”

On Dec. 23, Bonta’s office released a statement [advising](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/funds-being-held-flipcause-you-are-not-alone-attorney-general-bonta-announces) nonprofit groups to make documentation of their accounts with Flipcause and file consumer complaints with their respective states’ justice departments.

The class-action complaint, [filed](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.458371/gov.uscourts.cand.458371.1.0.pdf) in October by the nonprofit Latino Medical Student Association-Northeast, accused the company of creating “a financial nightmare for the thousands of charities that entrusted it with their donations,” alleging fraud and unjust enrichment. But on Dec. 19, the case was [closed](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.458371/gov.uscourts.cand.458371.29.0.pdf) indefinitely by the bankruptcy filing.

Eric Baum, one of the lawyers leading the lawsuit, accused Flipcause of “financial and moral bankruptcy” in a statement to SFGATE on Monday. He emphasized that the bankruptcy filing shouldn’t mean the charities are left without recourse.

“Now more than ever, many of the nonprofits need relief funding to fulfill important societal needs from providing diapers to families to sending winter clothing to war stricken orphanages,” Baum wrote. “These interests are critical in the bankruptcy proceedings.”
