            2026 will be the year the tech gets practical. The focus is already shifting away from building ever-larger
            language models and toward the harder work of making AI usable. In practice, that involves deploying smaller
            models where they fit, embedding intelligence into physical devices, and designing systems that integrate
            cleanly into human workflows.&nbsp;

            The experts TechCrunch spoke to see 2026 as a year of transition, one that evolves from brute-force scaling
            to researching new architectures, from flashy demos to targeted deployments, and from agents that promise
            autonomy to ones that actually augment how people work.&nbsp;

            showed how AI systems could “learn” to recognize objects in pictures by looking at millions of examples. The
            approach was computationally expensive, but made possible with GPUs. The result? A decade of hardcore AI
            research as scientists worked to invent new architectures for different tasks.
          </p>

          <p class="wp-block-paragraph">
            That culminated around 2020 when OpenAI launched GPT-3, which showed how simply making the model 100 times
            bigger unlocks abilities like coding and reasoning without requiring explicit training. This marked the
            transition into what Kian Katanforoosh, CEO and founder of AI agent platform Workera, calls the “age of
            scaling”: a period defined by the belief that more compute, more data, and larger transformer models would
            inevitably drive the next major breakthroughs in AI.
          </p>

          <p class="wp-block-paragraph">
            Today, many researchers think the AI industry is beginning to exhaust the limits of scaling laws and will
            once again transition into an age of research.

            Large language models are great at generalizing knowledge, but many experts say the next wave of enterprise

            Humans don’t just learn through language; we learn by experiencing how the world works. But LLMs don’t
            really understand the world; they just predict the next word or idea. That’s why many researchers believe
            the next big leap will come from world models: AI systems that learn how things move and interact in 3D
            spaces so they can make predictions and take actions.&nbsp;

            While researchers see long-term potential in robotics and autonomy, the near-term impact is likely to be

            billion between 2022 and 2025 to $276 billion by 2030, driven by the tech’s ability to generate interactive

            Agents failed to live up to the hype in 2025, but a big reason for that is because it’s hard to connect them
            to the systems where work actually happens. Without a way to access tools and context, most agents were

            While more agentic workflows might raise worries that layoffs may follow, Katanforoosh of Workera isn’t so
            sure that’s the message: “2026 will be the year of the humans,” he said.&nbsp;

          <p class="wp-block-paragraph">
            In 2024, every AI company predicted they would automate jobs out of needing humans. But the tech isn’t there
            yet, and in an unstable economy, that’s not really a popular rhetoric. Katanforoosh says next year, we’ll
            realize that “AI has not worked as autonomously as we thought,” and the conversation will focus more on how
            AI is being used to augment human workflows, rather than replace them.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p class="wp-block-paragraph">
            “And I think a lot of companies are going to start hiring,” he added, noting that he expects there to be new
            roles in AI governance, transparency, safety, and data management. “I’m pretty bullish on unemployment
            averaging under 4% next year.”
